  <h1>Get Started with the Axiom API</h1>
</div>

Axiom understands your resources and provides an API to ingest structured data logs, handle and manage your deployments. This is a **REST-style** API that uses JSON for serialization. 

This page covers the basics for interacting with the Axiom API, plus instructions for ingesting data and notes on some commonly used endpoints.

If you would like to manage Axiom more completely via API, we recommend you use [axiom-go](https://github.com/axiomhq/axiom-go).

## Authentication

You can generate an Ingest Token/Personal Token in your Axiom user settings for manual authentication in shell scripts or commands that use the Axiom API. 

Refer to the code sample below for an example of how to use this token in a curl request. All requests must use **HTTPS.**

### API Tokens

Axiom has two types of API tokens; 

- Personal API Tokens.
- Ingest Tokens.

### Personal API Token

The personal token can be retrieved from the users profile page, all users have a Personal Token. With the Personal Token users can access the Axiom API programmatically for custom integrations, management setting, or for tools such as the Axiom CLI.

The personal access token grants access to all resources available to the user on his behalf.  

Personal Access can be created under **Profile** or **Settings > Profile > Personal Tokens.**

### Ingest Token

Ingest Tokens just allows ingestion into the datasets the token is configured for. Use ingest tokens to send data to one or more datasets. Ingest tokens do not allow control of your organization, they are only used to ingest events. 

**For security reasons it is advised to use an Ingest Token with minimal privileges only.**

You can obtain the Ingest Token from the settings > Ingest Token of the Axiom deployment.

## Sending Events to Axiom API. 

To send events directly to Axiom API. We have the Go API client for your convenience:

- [Go Client](https://github.com/axiomhq/axiom-go)

## Ingesting data

`POST /api/v1/ingest/` 

Individual events are ingested as an HTTP POST request.


### Using curl command to ingest data 

=== "cURL"

```bash
curl -X POST '$YOUR_AXIOM_URL/api/v1/ingest' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer $INGEST_TOKEN or $PERSONAL_TOKEN' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/x-ndjson' \
  -d "{  \"description\": \"string\",  \"name\": \"string\",  \"scopes\": [    \"string\"  ]}"

```

## Body Specification 

The body of the POST should be a JSON encoded object containing key/value pairs. As an example, to report a GET request from the users `/download path with a duration of 231ms and a response size of 3012`. 

```
{ "path": "/download", "method": "GET", "duration_ms": 231, "res_size_bytes": 3012 }'

```

Axiom supports ingestion of different data formats:

- application/json
- application/nd-json
- text/csv

## Examples 

These examples sends an API event to Axiom. It is in the `neil-cmc` dataset.


## Ingest Events using NDJSON

`NDJSON` consists of individual lines where each individual line is any valid JSON text and each line is delimited with a newline character. The `NDJSON` payload should have the scheme of `{"id":1,"name":"Alice"} {"id":2,"name":"Bob"} {"id":3,"name":"Carol"}`


### Example Request using NDJSON 

=== "cURL"

```bash
curl -X 'POST' '$YOUR_AXIOM_URL/api/v1/datasets/neil-cmc/ingest' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer $INGEST_TOKEN or $PERSONAL_TOKEN' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/x-ndjson' -H 'x-axiom-org-id: axiom' \
  -d '{ "path": "/download", "method": "POST", "duration_ms": 231, "res_size_bytes": 3012, "endpoint":"/foo" }'

```

#### More examples

=== "cURL"

```bash
curl -X 'POST' '$YOUR_AXIOM_URL/api/v1/datasets/neil-cmc/ingest' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer $INGEST_TOKEN or $PERSONAL_TOKEN' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/x-ndjson' -H 'x-axiom-org-id: axiom' \
  -d '{"container": {"image": "front:master.0326.5","name": "tunnel-front"},"labels": {"component": "tunnel","pod-template-hash": "75f5666499"},"namespace": "kube-system","node": {"name": "32068356-vmss000002"},"pod": {"name": "fnxln","uid": "f0bdea4e57"},"replicaset": {"name": "75f5666499"}}}'

```

### Example Response

```

A successful POST Request returns a 200 response code JSON with details

```

## Ingest Events using JSON

The following example request contains grouped events. The structure of the `JSON` payload should have the scheme of `[ { "labels": { "key1": "value1", "key2": "value12" } }, ]` in which the array comprises of one or more JSON objects describing Events.

### Example Request using JSON

=== "cURL"

```bash

curl -X 'POST' '$YOUR_AXIOM_URL/api/v1/datasets/neil-cmc/ingest' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer $INGEST_TOKEN' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'x-axiom-org-id: axiom' \
  -d '[
        {
          "time":"2021-23-04302:11:23.222Z",
          "data":{"key1":"value1","key2":"value2"}
        },
        {
          "data":{"key3":"value3"},
          "labels":{"key4":"value4"}
        }
      ]'

```

### Grouping Events with different Labels

You can also group events with different labels into the same request as shown below: 

=== "cURL"

```bash
curl -X 'POST' '$YOUR_AXIOM_URL/api/v1/datasets/neil-cmc/ingest' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer $INGEST_TOKEN or $PERSONAL_TOKEN' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'x-axiom-org-id: axiom' \
  -d '[
  {
    "labels": {
      "author": "System1",
      "model": "whip.log"
    },
    "events": [
      {
        "timestamp": "2020-05-04T11:00:00+06:00",
        "elements": {
          "foo": "bar"
        }
      },
      {
        "timestamp": "2020-05-04T12:00:01+03:00",
        "attributes": {
          "status": "202",
          "address": "/src.php"
        }
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "labels": {
      "author": "System2",
      "model": "whip.log"
    },
    "events": [
      {
        "timestamp": "2020-05-04T13:00:02+02:00",
        "attributes": {
          "key2": "value2"
        }
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "labels": {
      "author": "System3",
      "model": "whip.log"
    },
    "events": [
      {
        "timestamp": "2020-05-04T14:00:03+02:00",
        "attributes": {
          "key3": "value3",
          "status": "200"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
]'

```

### Grouping Events with different tags

You can also group events with different tags into the same request as shown in the following example.

This request contains three events. The first two are tagged with `client1` and the third is tagged with `client2`:

=== "cURL"

```bash
curl -X 'POST' '$YOUR_AXIOM_URL/api/v1/datasets/neil-cmc/ingest' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer $INGEST_TOKEN or $PERSONAL_TOKEN' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'x-axiom-org-id: axiom' \
  -d '[
  {
    "tags": {
      "host": "client1",
      "origin": "data.log"
    },
    "events": [
      {
        "timestamp": "2021-05-07T12:03:05+02:00",
        "attributes": {
          "method": "GET"
        }
      },
      {
        "timestamp": "2021-05-07T12:03:01+02:00",
        "attributes": {
          "statuscode": "200",
          "city": "Utsunomiya"
        }
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "tags": {
      "host": "client2",
      "origin": "data.log"
    },
    "events": [
      {
        "timestamp": "2021-05-07T12:03:02+02:00",
        "attributes": {
          "country": "Mexico"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
]'

```

### Example Response

```

A successful POST Request returns a 200 response code JSON with details

```

## Ingest Events using CSV


The following example request contains events. The structure of the `CSV` payload uses a comma to separate values `['value1', 'value2', 'value3'].`

### Example Request using CSV

=== "cURL"

```bash
curl -X 'POST' '$YOUR_AXIOM_URL/api/v1/datasets/neil-cmc/ingest' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer $INGEST_TOKEN or $PERSONAL_TOKEN' \
  -H 'Content-Type: text/csv' -H 'x-axiom-org-id: axiom' \
  -d '['name', 'area', 'country_code2', 'country_code3']'

```

### Example Response
