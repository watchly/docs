  <h1>Ingest using Elastic Beats</h1>
</div>

[Elasticbeats](https://www.elastic.co/beats/) serves as a lightweight platform for data shippers that transfer information from the source to axiom and other tools based on the configuration. Before shipping data, beats collects metrics and logs from different sources, which later are deployed to your Axiom deployments.

There are different [Elastic Beats](https://www.elastic.co/beats/) you could use to ship logs and Axioms documentation provides a detailed step by step procedure on how to use each Beats.


## Filebeat

[Filebeat](https://www.elastic.co/beats/filebeat) is a lightweight shipper for logs, it helps you centralize logs, files and can read files from your system.

Filebeats is useful for workloads, system, application log files, and data logs you would like to ingest to Axiom in some way.

In the logging case, it helps centralize logs and files in a structured pattern by reading from your various applications, services, workloads and VMs, then shipping to your Axiom deployments.

### **Installation**

Visit the [Filebeat OSS download page](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/beats/filebeat-oss) to install Filebeat. For more information, check out Filebeat's [official documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/index.html)

**When downloading Filebeats, install the OSS version being that the non-oss version doesn't work with Axiom**

---

### **Configuration**

Axiom lets you ingest data with the ElasticSearch bulk ingest API.

In order for Filebeat to work, index lifecycle management (ILM) must be disabled. To do so, **add setup.ilm.enabled: false** to the filebeat.yml configuration file.

=== "Yaml"

```yaml
setup.ilm.enabled: false
filebeat.inputs:
  - type: log
    # Specify the path of the system log files to be sent to Axiom deployment. 
    paths: 
      - $PATH_TO_LOG_FILE
output.elasticsearch:
  # using the specified Axiom API
  hosts: ["$YOUR_AXIOM_URL:443/api/v1/datasets/<my-datasets>/elastic"]
  # api_key can be your ingest or personal token
  api_key: "user:token"
```

## Heartbeat

[Heartbeat](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/heartbeat/current/heartbeat-overview.html)  is a lightweight shipper for uptime monitoring. 

It Monitor your services, and ship response time to **Axiom**. It lets you check periodically check the status of your services and determine whether they are available. 

Heartbeat is useful when you need to verify that you’re meeting your service level agreements for service uptime.

**Heartbeat currently supports monitors for checking hosts via:**

- **ICMP** (v4 and v6) Echo Requests. Use the `icmp monitor` when you simply want to check whether a service is available. This monitor requires root access.
- **TCP** Use the tcp monitor to connect `via TCP.` You can optionally configure this monitor to verify the endpoint by sending and/or receiving a custom payload.
- **HTTP.** Use the http monitor to connect `via HTTP.` You can optionally configure this monitor to verify that the service returns the expected response, such as a specific status code, response header, or content.

---

### Installation 

Visit the [Heartbeat download page](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/heartbeat/current/heartbeat-installation-configuration.html#installation) to install Heartbeat on your system. 

---

### Configuration

Heartbeat provides monitors to check the status of hosts at set intervals. Heartbeat currently provides monitors for ICMP, TCP, and HTTP. 

You configure each monitor individually. In `heartbeat.yml`, specify the list of monitors that you want to enable. Each item in the list begins with a dash (-). 

The example below configures Heartbeat to use three monitors: *an icmp monitor, a tcp monitor, and an http monitor.* deployed instantly to **Axiom**. 

=== "Yaml"

```yaml
setup.ilm.enabled: false
heartbeat.monitors:
- type: icmp
  schedule: '*/5 * * * * * *' 
  hosts: ["myhost"]
  id: my-icmp-service
  name: My ICMP Service
- type: tcp
  schedule: '@every 5s' 
  hosts: ["myhost:12345"]
  mode: any 
  id: my-tcp-service
- type: http
  schedule: '@every 5s'
  urls: ["http://example.net"]
  service.name: apm-service-name 
  id: my-http-service
  name: My HTTP Service
output.elasticsearch:
  hosts: [""$YOUR_AXIOM_URL:443/api/v1/datasets/<dataset>/elastic"]
  # api_key can be your ingest or personal token
  api_key: "user:token"
```

## Auditbeat 

Auditbeat is a lightweight shipper that ships events in real time to **Axiom** for further analysis. It Collects your Linux audit framework data and monitor the integrity of your files. It is also used to evaluate the activities of users and processes on your system. 

You can also use Auditbeat to detect changes to critical files, like binaries and configuration files, and identify potential security policy violations.

---

### Installation 

Visit the [Auditbeat download page](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/beats/auditbeat) to install Auditbeat on your system. 

---
### Configuration

Auditbeat uses modules to collect audit information:

- Auditd
- File integrity
- System 

By default, Auditbeat uses a configuration that’s tailored to the operating system where Auditbeat is running.

To use a different configuration, change the module settings in `auditbeat.yml.`

The example below configures Auditbeat to use the ``file_integrity`` module configured to generate events whenever a file in one of the specified paths changes on disk. The events contains the file metadata and hashes, and it's deployed instantly to **Axiom**. 

=== "Yaml"

```yaml
setup.ilm.enabled: false
auditbeat.modules:
- module: file_integrity
  paths:
  - /usr/bin
  - /sbin
  - /usr/sbin
  - /etc
  - /bin
  - /usr/local/sbin
output.elasticsearch:
  hosts: ["$YOUR_AXIOM_URL:443/api/v1/datasets/<dataset>/elastic"]
  # api_key can be your ingest or personal token
  api_key: "user:token"
```

## Packetbeat

Packetbeat is a real-time network packet analyzer that you can integrate with **Axiom** to provide an application monitoring and performance analytics system between the servers of your network.

With **Axiom** you can use Packetbeat to capture the network traffic between your application servers, decode the application layer protocols (HTTP, MySQL, Redis, pgsql, thrift, mongodb and so on), and correlate the requests with the responses.

Packetbeat sniffs the traffic between your servers, and parses the application-level protocols on the fly directly into **Axiom**.

Currently, Packetbeat supports the following protocols:

- ICMP (v4 and v6)
- DHCP (v4)
- DNS
- HTTP
- AMQP 0.9.1
- Cassandra
- Mysql
- PostgreSQL
- Redis
- Thrift-RPC
- MongoDB
- Memcache
- NFS
- TLS
- SIP/SDP (beta)
